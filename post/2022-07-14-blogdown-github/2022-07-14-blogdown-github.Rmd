It's taken all day to get blogdown to sync with GitHub. I already had a
repo set up at <https://tedtwong.github.io/> and I had set up a blogdown
folder in R Studio, let's call it: R/blogdown.

I wasn't too familiar with how to set up git to sync the
R/blogdown/public folder with <https://tedtwong.github.io/> repo so that
I can version control blogdown files and host the files on GitHub at the
same time. What worked for me was to clone <https://tedtwong.github.io>
to R/blogdown/ and then change the folder name to 'public'. That way it
only synced the public files once blogdown does its thing.

Now I can edit the files in blogdown and then use git to sync with
github.io and everything works pretty well. One note of caution: put stuff (for example media files, etc.) into the contents folder and not directly into the public folder since rebuilding the blogdown site will overwrite the public folder from the contents folder.

I hope this helps someone in the same predicament.

I also created a resume using pagedown resume template. The code is here:

```{js move_disclaim, echo=FALSE}

```
That last bit of code is to move the disclaimer to the second page that I found on Stack Overflow written by [Phil](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72167895/pagedown-html-resume-how-to-move-disclaimer-section-within-aside-section-to-th).


Now it's time to fly.
