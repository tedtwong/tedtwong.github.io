      <description>Week 1 Assignment: Housing Prices In this exercise you’ll try to build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.
Imagine that house pricing is as easy as:
A house has a base cost of 50k, and every additional bedroom adds a cost of 50k. This will make a 1 bedroom house cost 100k, a 2 bedroom house cost 150k etc.
How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.</description>

      <description>You’re getting ready to staff the clinic for March this year. You want to know how many visits took place in March last year, to help you prepare.
Write a command that will produce a Series made up of the March data from df from all four clinic sites and save it to the variable march.
#import /;../,codecademylib3 import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame([ [&amp;#39;January&amp;#39;, 100, 100, 23, 100], [&amp;#39;February&amp;#39;, 51, 45, 145, 45], [&amp;#39;March&amp;#39;, 81, 96, 65, 96], [&amp;#39;April&amp;#39;, 80, 80, 54, 180], [&amp;#39;May&amp;#39;, 51, 54, 54, 154], [&amp;#39;June&amp;#39;, 112, 109, 79, 129]], columns=[&amp;#39;month&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;clinic_east&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;clinic_north&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;clinic_south&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;clinic_west&amp;#39;]) print(df) ## month clinic_east clinic_north clinic_south clinic_west ## 0 January 100 100 23 100 ## 1 February 51 45 145 45 ## 2 March 81 96 65 96 ## 3 April 80 80 54 180 ## 4 May 51 54 54 154 ## 5 June 112 109 79 129 # integer location within dataframe # locations are zero indexed and doesn&amp;#39;t include the ending integer march = df.</description>

      <description>Checking out Quarto today. It looks like a more comprehensive tool than R Markdown though it does a lot of similar things like being able to write text and include code cells (like Jupyter), but then also able to render the output into many formats (pdf, html, word, etc) using Pandoc. I guess that makes sense since it’s published by the same folks behind R Markdown and R Studio:</description>
