      <description>I asked ChatGPT for some python code to do distribution fitting and this is what it provided. I think I needed to edit it to fix some errors but it’s a nice solution.&#xA;First, I wanted to put in some R code that will allow me to display the results in blogdown, which is what I’m using to post to this site.&#xA;library(knitr) library(reticulate) knitr::knit_engines$set(python = reticulate::eng_python) The following python code was used for distribution fitting.</description>

      <description>Trying an introduction to copulas exercise, from (R-excerises), using the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gtouzin/samplestocksreturn)&#xA;Exercise 1 We’ll start by fitting the margin. First, do a histogram of both Apple and Microsoft returns to see the shape of both distributions.&#xA;returns &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;returns_00_17.csv&amp;quot;) hist(returns$Apple) hist(returns$Microsoft) Exercise 2 Both distributions seems symmetric and have a domain which contain positive and negative values. Knowing those facts, use the fitdist() function to see how the normal, logistic and Cauchy distribution fit the Apple returns dataset.</description>

      <description>I wanted to generate a set of random numbers without resorting to the rand() function in excel. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want results to change each time I opened the file but I wanted a way to seed different values when needed. I found this paper by Michael Lampton, Space Sciences Lab, UC Berkeley:&#xA;https://research.ssl.berkeley.edu/~mlampton/RandomSpreadsheet4.pdf&#xA;The paper has a formula for producing a set of random values using a modulus function on a large number while maintaining portability of such randomly generated numbers between different software and hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>Google Data Analytics Certificate</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally completed the Coursera Google Data Analytics Certificate.&#xA;I think the course is great for beginners in data analytics. For me it was a great refresher on SQL and R but the other sections were not all that useful. The course did motivate me to learn R (again) and this blog site is probably a result of that.&#xA;I think the course could use more on statistical thinking and spending more time on probability since data analysts could really use that in their work.</description>
