      <description>I wanted to generate a set of random numbers without resorting to the rand() function in excel. I found this paper by Michael Lampton, Space Sciences Lab, UC Berkeley: https://research.ssl.berkeley.edu/~mlampton/RandomSpreadsheet4.pdf Here is an excel file that generates random uniform [0,1] values from a seed using the formula within that paper: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_B94NiVy5mWPN-rX6z250NfoHedOerXSnY8M5GeTLv4/edit?usp=sharing</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally completed the Coursera Google Data Analytics Certificate.
I think the course is great for beginners in data analytics. For me it was a great refresher on SQL and R but the other sections were not all that useful. The course did motivate me to learn R (again) and this blog site is probably a result of that.
I think the course could use more on statistical thinking and spending more time on probability since data analysts could really use that in their work.</description>
