      <description>Week 1 Assignment: Housing Prices In this exercise youâ€™ll try to build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.
Imagine that house pricing is as easy as:
A house has a base cost of 50k, and every additional bedroom adds a cost of 50k. This will make a 1 bedroom house cost 100k, a 2 bedroom house cost 150k etc.
How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.</description>
