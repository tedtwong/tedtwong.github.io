      <description>Checking out Quarto today. It looks like a more comprehensive tool than rmarkdown though it does a lot of similar things like being able to write text and include code cells (like Jupyter), but then also able to render the output into many formats (pdf, html, word, etc) using Pandoc. I guess that makes sense since it’s published by the same folks behind rmarkdown and R Studio:
Quarto is a multi-language, next-generation version of R Markdown from RStudio, and includes dozens of new features and capabilities while at the same being able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.</description>

      <description>It’s taken all day to get blogdown to sync with GitHub. I already had a repo set up at https://tedtwong.github.io/ and I had set up a blogdown folder in R Studio, let’s call it: R/blogdown.
I wasn’t too familiar with how to set up git to sync the R/blogdown/public folder with https://tedtwong.github.io/ repo so that I can version control blogdown files and host the files on GitHub at the same time.</description>
