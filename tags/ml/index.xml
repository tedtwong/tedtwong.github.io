      <description>I took Andrew Ng’s ML course on Coursera in 2015, but the landscape has changed since then. The 2015 course had us build a neural network from scratch using matrix multiplication using Octave (open-source Matlab). Now in 2022 it’s taught using python, tensorflow, and Keras API rather than using matrix multiplication. This course is better if you just want to apply machine learning or learn what’s involved. This course allows you to do more in less time, but you come away with a fuzzier idea of what’s happening in the neural network.</description>

      <description>Week 1 Assignment: Housing Prices In this exercise you’ll try to build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.
Imagine that house pricing is as easy as:
A house has a base cost of 50k, and every additional bedroom adds a cost of 50k. This will make a 1 bedroom house cost 100k, a 2 bedroom house cost 150k etc.
How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.</description>
