      <description>I wanted to generate a set of random numbers without resorting to the rand() function in excel. I found this paper by Michael Lampton, Space Sciences Lab, UC Berkeley:
https://research.ssl.berkeley.edu/~mlampton/RandomSpreadsheet4.pdf
The paper has a formula for calculating a random value using a modulus function on a large number, but is also concerned with how portable such randomly generated numbers are between different software and hardware platforms. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt at a summary of the formulas used within that paper:</description>

      <title>Google Data Analytics Certificate</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally completed the Coursera Google Data Analytics Certificate.
I think the course is great for beginners in data analytics. For me it was a great refresher on SQL and R but the other sections were not all that useful. The course did motivate me to learn R (again) and this blog site is probably a result of that.
I think the course could use more on statistical thinking and spending more time on probability since data analysts could really use that in their work.</description>
