      <description>I asked ChatGPT for some python code to do distribution fitting and this is what it provided. I think I needed to edit it to fix some errors but it’s a nice solution.&#xA;First, I wanted to put in some R code that will allow me to display the results in blogdown, which is what I’m using to post to this site.&#xA;library(knitr) library(reticulate) knitr::knit_engines$set(python = reticulate::eng_python) The following python code was used for distribution fitting.</description>

      <description>Week 1 Assignment: Housing Prices In this exercise you’ll try to build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.&#xA;Imagine that house pricing is as easy as:&#xA;A house has a base cost of 50k, and every additional bedroom adds a cost of 50k. This will make a 1 bedroom house cost 100k, a 2 bedroom house cost 150k etc.&#xA;How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.</description>
