      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally completed the Coursera Google Data Analytics Certificate.
I think the course is great for beginners in data analytics. For me it was a great refresher on SQL and R but the other sections were not all that useful. The course did motivate me to delve a bit more into R and this blog site is probably a little bit in response to that.
I think the course could use a bit more on statistical thinking and diving a bit deeper into probability since data analysts could really use that in their work.</description>
